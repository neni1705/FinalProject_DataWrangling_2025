# FinalProject_DataWrangling_2025

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this individual/or group final project is to put into practice the tools and knowledge you’ve gained throughout this course. This project will:

1. Give you more experience using Python data-wrangling tools on real-world data.
2. Help you become a self-directed learner who can explore data and learn new techniques as needed.
3. Start or strengthen your data science portfolio with a reproducible analysis you can show to others.

You are expected to work on the project gradually throughout the term, not only in the last week.
